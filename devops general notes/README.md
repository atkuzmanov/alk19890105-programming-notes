```text
A blue/green deployment is a change management strategy for releasing software code. Blue/green deployments, which may also be referred to as A/B deployments require two identical hardware environments that are configured exactly the same way. While one environment is active and serving end users, the other environment remains idle.

Blue/green deployments are often used for consumer-facing applications and applications with critical uptime requirements. New code is released to the inactive environment, where it is thoroughly tested. Once the code has been vetted, the team makes the idle environment active, typically by adjusting a router configuration to redirect application program traffic. The process reverses when the next software iteration is ready for release.

Ascending Order
Numbers are said to be in ascending order when they are arranged from the smallest to the largest number.
E.g. 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 are arranged in ascending order.


Example 18
Arrange the following numbers in ascending order:
43, 52, 15, 26, 34

Solution:
4 cubed is 64, 5 squared is 25, 1 to the power of 5 is 1, 2 to the power of 6 is 64, 3 to the power of 4 is 81

The numbers arranged in ascending order are 1, 25, 64, 64, 81.
So, 15, 52, 43, 26, 34 are arranged in ascending order.


Descending Order
Numbers are said to be in descending order when they are arranged from the largest to the smallest number.

E.g. 25, 21, 17, 13 and 9 are arranged in descending order.


Example 19
Arrange the following numbers in descending order:

42, 52, 24, 33

Solution:
4 squared is 16, 5 squared is 25, 2 to the power of 4 is 16, 3 to the power of 3 is 27

The numbers arranged in descending order are 27, 25, 16, 16.
So, 33, 52, 42, 24 are arranged in descending order.

Article Number: 117098

In general terms, Ascending means smallest to largest, 0 to 9, and/or A to Z and Descending means largest to smallest, 9 to 0, and/or Z to A.

Ascending order means the smallest or first or earliest in the order will appear at the top of the list:
For numbers or amounts, the sort is smallest to largest. Lower numbers or amounts will be at the top of the list.
For letters/words, the sort is alphabetical from A to Z.
For data with numbers and letters/words, such as address lines, the sort is most likely alphanumeric meaning 0-9 is sorted first then followed by A-Z.
For dates, the sort will be oldest/earliest dates to most recent. The oldest dates will be at the top of the list.
Descending order means the largest or last in the order will appear at the top of the list:
For numbers or amounts, the sort is largest to smallest. Higher numbers or amounts will be at the top of the list.
For letters/words, the sort is alphabetical from Z to A.
For data with numbers and letters/words, such as address lines, the sort is most likely alphanumeric meaning Z to A is sorted first then followed by 9-0.
For dates, the sort will be most recent dates to the oldest/earliest dates. The most recent/latest dates will be at the top of the list.


NOTE: This is a general explanation of Ascending and Descending means. A program's exact sort order function and its results can vary. Please consult the program's specific help resources for additional information. If you cannot find "sort" specifically, search for where the sort function is located, such as Queries, Reports, or Exports, in the program.

Introduction
The Cron daemon is a built-in Linux utility that runs processes on your system at a scheduled time. Cron reads the crontab (cron tables) for predefined commands and scripts.

By using a specific syntax, you can configure a cron job to schedule scripts or other commands to run automatically.

This guide shows you how to set up a cron job in Linux, with examples.

tutorial on how to set up linux cron job
Prerequisites
A system running Linux
Access to a command line/terminal window (Ctrl–Alt–T or Ctrl–Alt–F2)
A user account with root or sudo privileges
Basic Crontab Syntax
Cron reads the configuration files for a list of commands to execute. The daemon uses a specific syntax to interpret the lines in the crontab configuration tables.

To be able to set up a cron job, we need to understand the basic elements that make up this syntax. The standard form for a crontab line is as follows:

a b c d e /directory/command output
So, the parts of a cron command are:

1. The first five fields a b c d e specify the time/date and recurrence of the job.

2. In the second section, the /directory/command specifies the location and script you want to run.

3. The final segment output is optional. It defines how the system notifies the user of the job completion.

1. Cron Job Time Format
The first five fields in the command represent numbers that define when and how often the command runs. A space separates each position, which represents a specific value.

The table below summarizes possible values for the fields and the example syntax:

Field	Possible Values	Syntax	Description
[a] – Minute	0 – 59	7 * * * * 	The cron job is initiated every time the system clock shows 7 in the minute’s position.
[b] – Hour	0 – 23	0 7 * * *	The cron job runs any time the system clock shows 7am (7pm would be coded as 19).
[c] – Day	0 – 31	0 0 7 * * 	The day of the month is 7 which means that the job runs every 7th day of the month.
[d] – Month	0 = none and 12 = December	0 0 0 7 *	The numerical month is 7 which determines that the job runs only in July.
[e] – Day of the Week	0 = Sunday and 7 = Sunday	0 0 * * 7 	7 in the current position means that the job would only run on Sundays.
2. Command to Execute
The next section specifies the command to execute. It represents the exact directory and filename of the script or commands you want cron to complete. For example:

/root/backup.sh
In our example, the command looks at the root directory of the system and runs the backup.sh script. You may specify any script or command you wish.

3. Output (Optional)
By default, cron sends an email to the owner of the crontab file when it runs. This is a convenient way to keep track of tasks. Keep in mind that regular or minor tasks can fill up your inbox quickly.

As this is an optional feature, you can prevent that scenario by disabling the output email. To turn off email output, add the following string, >/dev/null 2>&1, after the timing and command fields.

* * * * * directory/command >/dev/null 2>&1
4. Using Operators (Optional)
For efficiency, cron syntax also uses operators. Operators are special characters that perform operations on the provided values in the cron field.

An asterisk (*) stands for all values. Use this operator to keep tasks running during all months, or all days of the week.
A comma (,) specifies separate individual values.
A dash (–) indicates a range of values.
A forward-slash (/) is used to divide a value into steps. (*/2 would be every other value, */3 would be every third, */10 would be every tenth, etc.)
Setting Up a Cron Job
To configure a cron job, open the crontab with a preferred text editor and input the syntax for the command you want to run.

How to Edit the crontab File?
To open the crontab configuration file for the current user, enter the following command in your terminal window:

crontab –e
You can add any number of scheduled tasks, one per line.

cronjob configuration file to set up cron job
Once you have finished adding tasks, save the file and exit. The cron daemon will read and execute the instructions provided.

Note:  Cron does not need to be restarted to apply changes.

Edit crontab for a Different User
To edit the crontab for a another user, enter the following command:

crontab –u other_username –e
Cron Job Examples
When specifying jobs, use the asterisk to specify all values. Putting a value in one of the fields only runs the command on that value. For example:

* 2 0 * 4 /root/backup.sh
Even though it’s set to run at 2 am, it only runs when the first of the month (0) falls on a Wednesday (4). If you change to the following:

* 2 0 * * /root/backup.sh
The command runs the first of every month at 2 am. The following table provides a few basic commands using the /root/backup.sh file from our previous examples.

Cron Job	Command
Run Cron Job Every Minute	* * * * * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job Every 30 Minutes	30 * * * * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job Every Hour	0 * * * */root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job Every Day at Midnight	0 0 * * * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job at 2 am Every Day	0 2 * * * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job Every 1st of the Month	0 0 1 * * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job Every 15th of the Month	0 0 15 * * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job on December 1st – Midnight	0 0 0 12 * /root/backup.sh
Run Cron Job on Saturday at Midnight	0 0 * * 6 /root/backup.sh
Using Special Characters
You can use the slash to divide a time string into steps. To run a backup every 15 minutes:

*/15 * * * *
The * means all values, and the /15 counts and repeats every 15th minute.

Use the dash character to specify a range. To run the code every weekday at 4 am:

0 4 * * 1-5 /root/backup.sh
In this case, 1-5 specifies Monday – Friday.

Use a comma to specify individual instances when the code should run:

0 4 * * 2,4 /root/backup.sh
This would run the code at 4 am on Tuesday and Thursday.

Some wildcards can be combined. Make the command run every other day at 37 minutes past the hour:

37 1-23/2 * * * /root/backup.sh
1-23 specifies the range of hours, /2 sets the interval to every other hour.

List Existing Cron Jobs
You can list all cron jobs on your system without opening the crontab configuration file. Type in the following command in a terminal window:

crontab –l
Terminal output for the crontab list command in Linux
Conclusion
You now have a good understanding of how to use cron to schedule tasks in Linux. Use the examples presented in this tutorial to create and schedule cron jobs on your system. Over time, expand the tasks by using special characters to automate most of your mundane tasks.

Mac crontab is never created

> References
> <https://superuser.com/questions/201172/mac-crontab-is-never-created>

This isn't about the editor, it's about user permissions. First become root:

    sudo su -

Then edit the crontab for the proper user:

    crontab -u username -e

After saving the file, can verify that it saved properly by running this:

    crontab -u username -l

What is the 'working directory' when cron executes a job?

> References
> <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38951/what-is-the-working-directory-when-cron-executes-a-job>

Add `cd /home/xxxx/Documents/Scripts/` if you want your job to run in that directory. There's no reason why cron would change to that particular directory. Cron runs your commands in your home directory.

As for `ssmtp`, it might not be in your default `PATH`. Cron's default path is implementation-dependent, so check your man page, but in all likelihood `ssmtp` is in `/usr/sbin` which is not in your default `PATH`, only root's.

    PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
    15 7 * * * cd /home/xxxx/Documents/Scripts && ./email_ip_script.sh

How to schedule a bash script to run at a certain time

> References
> <https://superuser.com/questions/1185046/how-to-schedule-a-bash-script-to-run-at-a-certain-time>

Try this:

<!-- language: bash -->

    #!/bin/bash
    
    work() {
    	# put your job here e.g.
        ffmpeg -re -i "input" output.mp4
    }
    
    echo "Launching background job..."
    work &
    workPID=$!
    RUNNING=true
    
    while true; do
        # If no child process, then exit
        [ $(pgrep -c -P$$) -eq 0 ] && echo "All done" && exit
    	HOUR="$(date +'%H')"
    	if [ $HOUR -ge 17 -a $HOUR -lt 21 ] ; then
    		if [ "$RUNNING" == false ]; then
    			echo "Start work..."
    			kill -CONT $workPID
    			RUNNING=true
    		fi
    	else
    		if [ "$RUNNING" == true ]; then
    			echo "Stop work..."
    			kill -TSTP $workPID
    			RUNNING=false
    		fi
    	fi
    	sleep 2
    done

The script launches the job as a child process with `work &`, then monitors that process and freezes/unfreezes it as required.

Steps to create cron job manually
Step 1: Give crontab privilege
Before we start we need to give crontab privilege to the respective user. For the sake of this article I will create some sample cron job for root and deepak user, so I will assign permission for these two users.

Append the username to /etc/cron.allow

# cat /etc/cron.allow
root
deepak
 

Step 2: Create cron file
Create a cron file for root user

# touch /var/spool/cron/root
# /usr/bin/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
Create a cron file for deepak user

# touch /var/spool/cron/deepak
# /usr/bin/crontab /var/spool/cron/deepak
 

Step 3: Schedule your job
I will create some dummy jobs. To give a demonstration I will schedule a job to clear temporary files every midnight for both the user

# echo "0 0 * * * rm -f /tmp/root/*" >> /var/spool/cron/root

# echo "0 0 * * * rm -f /tmp/deepak/*" >> /var/spool/cron/deepak
 

Step 4: Validate the cron job content
Here you can use -u to define the username for which you wish to perform the cron action/

# crontab -u deepak -l
0 0 * * * rm -f /tmp/deepak/*

# crontab -u root -l
0 0 * * * rm -f /tmp/root/*
So our cron jobs are updated successfully for both root and deepak user.

NOTE:
You do not need to restart your crond service for the new changes.
 

Script to create cron job using bash shell script
Let us put them all together in a script

#!/bin/bash
   if [ `id -u` -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "This script can be executed only as root, Exiting.."
      exit 1
   fi

case "$1" in
   install|update)

	CRON_FILE="/var/spool/cron/root"

	if [ ! -f $CRON_FILE ]; then
	   echo "cron file for root doesnot exist, creating.."
	   touch $CRON_FILE
	   /usr/bin/crontab $CRON_FILE
	fi

	# Method 1
	grep -qi "cleanup_script" $CRON_FILE
	if [ $? != 0 ]; then
	   echo "Updating cron job for cleaning temporary files"
           /bin/echo "0 0 * * * rm -f /home/deepak/cleanup_script.sh" >> $CRON_FILE
	fi

	# Method 2
	grep -qi "cleanup_script" $CRON_FILE
	if [ $? != 0 ]; then
	   echo "Updating cron job for cleaning temporary files"
	   crontab -u deepak -l >/tmp/crontab
           /bin/echo "0 0 * * * rm -f /home/deepak/cleanup_script.sh" >> /tmp/crontab
	   crontab -u deepak /tmp/crontab
	fi

	;;
	
	*)
	
	echo "Usage: $0 {install|update}"
	exit 1
    ;;

esac
Here I have shared two methods to update cron job using a shell script for root and deepak user.

You can validate the changes after executing your script

# /tmp/script.sh install
Updating cron job for cleaning temporary files
 

List the cron jobs
# crontab -u root -l
0 0 * * * rm -f /home/deepak/cleanup_script.sh

# crontab -u deepak -l
0 0 * * * rm -f /home/deepak/cleanup_script.sh
So all is working as expected.

```

How to schedule tasks using at command on Linux

Learning how schedule and manage tasks using the at program
Requirements
Root permissions to start the atd daemon
Having the at program installed
Difficulty
EASY
Conventions
# - requires given linux commands to be executed with root privileges either directly as a root user or by use of sudo command
$ - requires given linux commands to be executed as a regular non-privileged user
Introduction
During the administration of a system, being able to schedule a task for a later execution it's one crucial ability: to perform a backup of a database for example, or perhaps to run a maintenance script. Less known than cron or anacron, the at program let us do this in a pretty easy way: in this tutorial we will learn how to use it and how it is different from the programs mentioned above.
What is at?
Unlike cron, which let us run a task on a regular basis, at gives us the ability to execute a command or a script at a specified date and hour, or after a given interval of time. Minutes, hours, days or weeks can be used as units. It's even possible to use certain "keywords" as midnight or teatime (which corresponds to 4pm).

Installing at
If not installed by default, at should be available in almost all distributions' repositories.

To install it on Fedora, just run:
# dnf install at
On RHEL or CentOS yum is still the default package manager:
# yum install at
On Debian or Ubuntu:
# apt-get install at
On Archlinux:
# pacman -S at
Starting the daemon
Once the program it's installed, we must start the atd daemon and eventually enable it if we want it to be launched automatically at boot. I will here assume the use of systemd as the init system. The command must be executed with root privileges:
# systemctl enable --now atd.service
Scheduling a job from the at prompt
With everything in place, we can now use at. Let's suppose we want to run a command 1 minute from now. The correct syntax would be:
$ at now + 1 minute
To run the same command at 4pm, three days from now, instead, we would run:
$ at 4pm + 3 days
Once the above line is executed, the at prompt will appear, waiting for us to enter the command to be executed after the specified time interval:
$ at now + 1 minutes
at> echo "Hello world" > test.txt
at> 
job 4 at Tue Dec 19 11:29:00 2017
To exit the at prompt we should press the CTRL+d key combination. At this point we will presented with a summary of the scheduled task, which will show us the job id (4 in this case) and the date at which it will be executed.

Just as an example, we entered a trivial command to show how at works. A minute from now, the "Hello world" string will be written to the file test.txt, which will be automatically created if doesn't already exist.
Schedule the execution of a script
Instead of specifying the command to be executed, interactively, from the prompt, we can instruct at to execute an existing script or program simply by passing it as an argument to the -f flag or, alternatively, by using the < redirection operator. Therefore, assuming we want to run a script which is present in our current working directory, we would run:
# Using the dedicated -f flag
$ at now + 1 minute -f script.sh
# Using the < redirection operator $ at now + 1 minute < script.sh
Manage scheduled jobs
To queue, examine or delete jobs scheduled with at, we can either use dedicated commands like atrm and atq or run at with specific flags, the latter being just aliases for the former. For example, say we want to obtain a list of all pending jobs scheduled with at by our user:
 $ atq
4      Tue Dec 19 11:29:00 2017 a egdoc
The above command, if launched as root, will display the task scheduled by all users in the system.

To delete a queued job, we could use atrm or run at with the equivalent flags: -r or -d. The job to be deleted must be referenced by its number. In the case above, we would therefore run:
 $ atrm 4 
Conclusions
Although simpler than cron or anacron, the at program can be very useful in certain situations: to run a program with a specific delay or when you know exactly the time in which the task must be executed. Reference the manual for further information, and add this little tool to your toolbox, it will surely come in handy.

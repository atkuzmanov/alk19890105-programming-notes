It's a matter of perception and choice.

Change the way you look at things, your perception.

You control your thoughts, there is a link between body and mind, if you give up, your body will give up and die.

Know yourself.

You need to know yourself and recognise when you enter in the strain zone, when you notice, try to go back in the comfort, calm zone.

Look for the warning signs of strain.

Live life with an oscillating rhythm, don't be on the red line all the time.

Rest before a challenge.

Rest after a challenge.

Chronobiology?!

Talk to others.
Create 'me time'.
Prioritise what you do by importance.
Do a thing a day to improve your energy.

Energy

What do you prefer time or energy?

Build downtime in your day.

Are you moving towards something or moving away from something, poverty for example, but moving away from poverty reminds you of it's existence. Move towards something that you want, rather than away from something you don't want!

You are what you think.

I couldn't catch whether it was "Open mind" or "Open minds" by Andy... someone, so it could be one of the following:

The Eisenhower Method

The "Eisenhower Method" stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."[7][8]

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent,[9][10] and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix"[11]). Tasks are then handled as follows:

Tasks in

Important/Urgent quadrant are done immediately and personally[12] e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.[11]
Important/Not Urgent quadrant get an end date and are done personally[12] e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.[11]
Unimportant/Urgent quadrant are delegated[12] e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.[11]
Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant are dropped[12] e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.[11]
This method is said to have been used by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[12]

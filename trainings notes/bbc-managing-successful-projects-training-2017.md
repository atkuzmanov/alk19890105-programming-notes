Project lifecycle:

`Define -> Shape/Initiate -> Plan -> Implement -> Handover`

Project theme:

`Business Case & Approvals -> Approach -> Planning -> Controls -> Business Change -> Stakeholders -> Governance & Steering Groups -> Benefits`

What is a project?

- Temporary endeavour designed to produce a product, service or result.
- Defined beginning and end.
- Timeboxed.
- Resource runs out.

A project is a temporary organisation created to deliver a specific outcome at a defined point in time with agreed resources.

- Features of a project:

A one-off set of activities
Focus on achieving tactical and operational business objectives
Tends to be shorter in duration
Narrower scope
Risks easily defined
Results in localised change
Few deliverables
Lower levels of ambiguity
Impacted less by external changes

- Most projects fall into four types:

Scoping/Feasibility: The aim is to develop some recommendations and may lead to further projects.

Implementation: A solution has been chosen and the project just has to “make it happen”.

Improvement: A current situation has to be investigated and a solution identified and implemented.

Innovation: Seek new, creative solutions and find ways to implement them.

- Projects can vary hugely. Some are small and well-defined, and it's immediately clear what has to be done.

Others are trickier. The goals are more ambiguous, and the stakeholders harder to manage.

Your skills as a manger, diplomat and psychologist will all play their part.

- "I found in my business that choosing the right individual for the job has made the difference between success and failure.

I try to surround myself with people who complement my skills, or are just plain better at certain jobs." - Unknown

- `Project Owner = Project Sponsor = Project Manager`
The Project Sponsor may represent the project at the Project Board or Management level

- Project Manager

The Project Manager leads the project on a day to day basis.

He or she is responsible for ensuring the project delivers against its objectives,

and plans and reports progress to the sponsor.

The Project Manager motivates and manages the individual team members.

Project Management differs from Line Management in some important respects.

Project Managers may have to negotiate with Line Managers to resource people for their project teams.

As those people report directly to their Line Managers, Project Managers need to use their influencing and negotiating skills to manage their teams effectively.

---

- Effective teams are creative and energised, they communicate well inside and outside of the team,

and they trust each other, resolving conflicts along the way.

They have a commitment to achieving results, and are prepared to learn from each other.

---

- Effective Project Governance defines areas of responsibility and accountability.

This frees the project group to work within their roles and ensures decisions are made

and issues are resolved at the right level.

It is important to know who to report progress to, and agree times to do it.

Project Governance facilitates approval for resources and decisions and can move the project onto the next stage.

- Overview of Project Lifecycle

A lifecycle breaks a project down into a number of discrete phases; it reduces overall project risk by ensuring that the right things are done at the right time, and by creating specific decision points for proceeding with the project.

A project Lifecycle, when appropriately applied, ensures that proper controls are applied at the right time through a series of 'phases' and 'gates'. Many costly mistakes can be avoided if the right decisions are made early on in a project. Furthermore, the concepts of phases are extremely useful in the overall planning of a project.

**The five project stages**

[1] **`Define`**

====

The definition phase is the formal start of a project whereby the business articulates, at a high level, the rationale for the project and its strategic alignment.

- The definition phase is the formal start of a project whereby the business articulates, at a high level, the rationale for the project and its strategic alignment. It appoints someone responsible to move it forward. Two key things begin to take shape during this phase: the Investment Case and Approvals (which ultimately may take the form of an Investment Proposal (IP), and the project plan. Both of these will expand and evolve through the early phases of the project. For instance a business case might start with a germ of an idea at the mandate stage and grow into a fully formed investment proposal, whilst the plan might start by only looking at the activities and responsibilities for the next phase, but will need to evolve into a full project plan by the end of the planning phase. Sponsorship is confirmed.

End of phase gate review

End of stage 'gates' provide an opportunity to make go/no-go decisions about the project.

Shaping Gate: Check strategic fit and overall priority.

'How to'
Agree with the sponsor and all other key stakeholders what needs to be completed in the Definition Phase as early as possible. Agree the format for the gate approval; it could be as simple as an email or may require a formal meeting with multiple stakeholders. The key to this phase is to do the appropriate amount of work to justify investment in the shaping phase (aim for quality not quantity). Definition phases that drag on might indicate that too much control/overhead is being applied early on.

Key questions

- What is the minimum documentation required to get to the next phase?
- How much process is required for the project? It's important to get the right balance between control and overhead.
- Are the benefits well articulated?

[2] **`Shape / Initiate`**

===

The shaping phase starts to elaborate the requirements, scope the deliverables and articulate high level costs, benefits and approach associated with various options.

- Project Shaping / Initiation 1

The starting point is: What needs to be achieved with this project?

This is the primary objective, and should be clearly defined,

along with: Why does this need to be achieved?

A good way to achieve this is by using the acronym S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

Be specific, focusing on what you want to achieve or improve.

Understand what is measurable - for example what data do you need to track achievement?

Work out what is realistically achievable.

Make sure the objective is relevant to the organisation, and can actually be addressed by the people working on it.

Define a point in time when the objective will be achieved.

- Objectives and deliverables sometimes get confused.

  - Objectives, and the performance they relate to, are about achieving a measurable beneficial outcome.

  - Deliverables are the tangible things that the project will produce in order to enable the objectives to be achieved.

    They're things you can see or touch, often also referred to as products, or outputs.

    Deliverables usually have a required quality level known as specification at least, you'd like to think so.

    An 'out of scope' deliverable is something that will: Not be produced by the project

  - Benefits are the positive outcomes of a project, and need to be identified at the initiation stage.

Sometimes they only become apparent after the project's been completed, so you'll need to work out how they will be measured.

Benefits can be tangible and intangible.

Tangible benefits include: efficiency savings, rationalisation or elimination of duplicated effort,

improved products or services, and increased productivity.

Intangible benefits include: improved staff morale, reduced risk, improved decision making, and increased alignment with company values.

**`Project Shaping / Initiation 2`**

===

It's at the initiation stage that the project is scoped.

'Scope' describes what's contained within the project.

Locations, people, products and services.

Scoping is a great way of defining the boundaries of the project, and what the project will produce.

It also defines what will not be produced, referred to as 'out of scope deliverables'.

When you've scoped your project, you can start writing the Project Definition Document (PDD).

In addition to Objectives, Deliverables and Scope your PDD (Project Definition Document) will need to include:

Milestones, which are key, defined events which must start or end at a particular time.

Assumptions. These are based on constraints or ‘givens’ that you already know about.

Making assumptions involves some calculated guesswork often based on what has happened before.

And risks.

By identifying potential risks early on you will be giving your Stakeholders a ‘heads up’ on potentially difficult areas of the project.

What would you expect to have at the end of the shape/initiate stage?

[3] **`Plan`**

The planning phase represents the ramp up of the project where detailed plans are elaborated upon and resources are allocated. The Investment Proposal (including benefits) is finalised.

- We need to develop the project plan in more detail.

This includes identifying risks, and planning communications to the stakeholders.

The first step in the process is to define the project 'milestones'.

Once your milestones are in place you can start breaking the project down into a series of tasks, or 'work packages'.

This is known as a Work Breakdown Structure.

The Work Breakdown Structure enables you to describe in granular detail what tasks have to be done in order to reach the next milestone.

- Each of the tasks you've detailed in the work breakdown structure need resourcing within your defined budget.

Resources include people, money, equipment and facilities, and are often scarce.

For each activity in your WBS, work out what you will need, how long it will take,

and the earliest start time, and the latest finish time.

Every activity has a ‘Duration’ – the length of time it takes to carry it out.

The Critical Path is the shortest path of activities from start to finish.

There is no built in slack on the Critical Path and any over-run can delay the whole project.

Activities on the critical path therefore need exceptionally close monitoring to ensure this doesn’t happen.

- Its people who are at the heart of every project.

As project manager, the responsibility for who should be doing what and when is yours.

There's a useful tool to help you define roles and responsibilities and help plan communication with stakeholders.

It's called a *`R.A.C.I.`* matrix.

`R`: Who is Responsible for doing that task?

`A`: Who is Accountable for ensuring it is done, and on time?

`C`: Who should be Consulted, or involved with decisions about it?

`I`: Who should be Informed about the progress of the task?

As the project manager, what are you responsible for?
Driving and delivering the implementation of the project

- Before moving on to the implementation stage, it's important to stand back, and review the risks associated with your project.

This should ensure you're in a position to deal with unexpected problems,

and review the current state of your project, before you start spending.

Many things have the potential to go wrong.

a supplier missing a key delivery deadline, staff getting ill, equipment failing, and so on.

By having a plan you can stay in control, and keep your project on track.

[4] **`Implement`**

The implementation phase is where the agreed deliverables are produced and where the business accepts those outputs.

- This is where you put those carefully made plans into action, and the project is finally delivered.

It's crucial you're in full control, which means monitoring

and assessing your project team, your suppliers, and your project partners.

- The project manager is at the heart of that process.

It's essential to keep asking questions throughout, identifying risks and issues which may jeopardise the project.

It can be useful to list your key questions:

Are deliverables being produced when they are needed?

Are budgets being spent according to the plan?

Are suppliers and partners doing what they are expected to?

Are project team members doing what they are expected to?

By continually addressing key issues throughout the project, you can avoid any nasty surpises later on.

You can use the milestone plan, or GANT chart, to track progress of activities and production of deliverables.

The RACI matrix helps tackle the work of suppliers, partners and project team, and any other stakeholders.

- What if your carefully made plans have to change?

Things can and do change and you need to know how to manage those changes.

This is reassuringly referred to as Change Control.

Change control aims to assess the impact of issues that arise during the project.

Typical examples of Project Issues are things like a request for change, a request for a deliverable

deliverable that was not in the original specification, or a question or concern raised by a Stakeholder.

Remember the quality, cost, time triangle, and how changes in the scope, budget or schedule affect the overall project.

You need the confidence to assess whether or not the potential changes are too great to make the project viable.

- Good communication is at the heart of any successful project.

You need to communicate to your project team.

Your key stakeholders, and project owner, will need regular progress reports.

This can be a great chance to talk about the project's achievements so far.

Project Reports will usually use some kind of Red-Amber-Green colour coding

coding to highlight progress and potential problems.

Typically they include information about what activities have been completed so far

against what was planned, what benefits have been achieved

and what resources have been used. It’s also an opportunity to discuss

discuss any issues or risks and what action is needed to address them,

as well as highlighting what is planned next.

- When a project finally delivers, that's when you can finally sit back and measure your success as a project manager.

There may have been times that you felt like a duck: on the surface calmly swimming along, but underneath your feet frantically paddling.

But now you can begin to see the tangible results of your efforts, and move on to Project Close.

[5] **`Handover`**

The handover phase represents the formal acceptance into the business where benefits and any residual changes will be managed and tracked.

- Closing the Project.

Once everything's been delivered and the project's achieved its objectives,

you can bring the project to a close and disband your project team.

It's also the time to step back and review the project.

At the end of the project, the deliverables get handed over to the people who'll actually have to use them.

It's those people who live with the results of the project, and they are the best judges of its success.


* Delivering the project includes quality assessment and review.

Your stakeholders and Project Board have to be happy that everything has been delivered to an acceptable standard.

You'll probably need to prepare a Project Completion Report

and get this signed off by the project sponsor and/or the Project Board.

You'll need to check what needs to be archived and retained for future reference, and if there's any other specific documentation required.

- Finally, it's worth taking the time out to really review your project.

What went well and if you’re honest, what didn’t go so well?

Before you close the project and disband the project team

it can be worth talking to your team members and getting feedback from them.

Every project is a learning experience to some extent and in recognising that you can learn valuable lessons for next time.

Finally, don’t forget to celebrate, and make sure you reward the team for all their hard work.

**Stakeholder analysis**

Stakeholders are people who can influence a project's success. Broadly there are four types of stakeholder, and it is helpful to be able to identify them as they should be dealt with differently. 

- The blocker

    "I really can't see how this is going to work. I have to say I'm opposed to it."

    "This project is bound to fail."

    "You may as well give up now and save us all a headache." 

    Blockers can be a problem, particularly if they are in a senior, influential position. Sometimes you have to involve other people to influence a blocker and at other times they must be overruled, perhaps by a more senior manager who is a supporter.

- The critic

    "At the moment this project has the potential to be a PR disaster."

    "If only we could move in stages it would be easier to manage."

    "You have to tread carefully when it's a matter of public opinion."

    Critics need not be a problem to you. Often they will be challenging, but they bring a different perspective which is always worth considering. Their ideas can sometimes improve the quality of your plans.

- The passive bystander

    "I'm not bothered if it goes ahead or not."

    "I'm sure it makes good business sense, but it won't really affect me."

    "Just send me an occasional email to keep me updated on the project will you?"

    Typically, passive bystanders take little notice of change and 'go with the flow'. They may realise later on that the change will affect them, then they become a different type of stakeholder. It's important to keep communication open with them and to encourage their feedback.

- The positive supporter

    "This is a great idea."

    "It'll mean we're representing people from all parts of the UK."

    "I'm 100% behind this project and will do all I can to make sure it succeeds."

    Positive supporters are really useful as you can enlist their help to encourage other people and spread the message about the benefits of change.

Stakeholders are people who can influence the project.

Stakeholder analysis involves assessing who can help to move the project along, and ultimately make it a success.

When working on a project, make a list of stakeholders

and assess their potential influence, and how they may impact on the project.

Develop plans to engage with them and ensure positive support, and make sure you review their behaviours regularly.

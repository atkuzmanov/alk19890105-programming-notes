BBC News service - trusted, up to date, timely.
BBC News product - BBC News app.

A project is a temporary organisation created to deliver a specific outcome at a defined point in time with agreed resources.

** What is a project?
- Temporary endeavour designed to produce a product, service or result.
- Defined beginning and end.

Ongoing product ownership, resource, roadmaps etc.


* From projects to products
- Strategic long term view
- Ongoing ownership
- User centred approach
- Agile methodologies

In projects you deliver business objectives, in products you deliver for the user, the users are at the heart of the matter.


Communication - what the users want, what the stakeholders want, and bridging those requirements.



Product manager - managing expectation.

Put things into roadmaps.

(*) Product team and roles

Product Manager: The conductor. Go to person responsible for the success of the product end to end.

Project Manager: Keeping schedules, managing and reporting risks.

Business Analyst (BA): Researches and specifies functionality, down in the detail of requirements and test plans.

Design and User Experience (UX): Think about underlying architecture, interactions, prototypes, and visual design.

Developers: Write code and do technical designs.

Testers: Test the code and functionality, feature by feature.


(*) Product Vision

* Aspirational, Inspiring an "Igniting Purpose"

* Can accommodate changes over time

* Something all disciplines can identify with

* Helps focus product teams in a practical way


* Product Vision Statement - A formula

For [defined market], [product] is the only [product category] that offers [differentiator]. This means that [benefit].

[defined market] - Who we are for.

[product] - Who are we.

[product category] - What we do.

[differentiator] - What makes us different.

[benefit] - What it means to the customer or user.


* Product Vision Statement – An example

For ART LOVERS, the ART GUIDE is the only FREE APP that provides A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS ACROSS THE UK. This means you can always FIND THE BEST PLACES TO GO AND TOP DISCOUNTS WHEREVER YOU ARE.

[ART LOVERS] - Who we are for.

[FREE APP] - Who are we.

[A ONE-STOP SHOP FOR PUBLIC EXHIBITIONS ACROSS THE UK] - What makes us different.

[FIND THE BEST PLACES TO GO AND TOP DISCOUNTS WHEREVER YOU ARE] - What it means to the customer or user.


(*) Planning and prioritisation

"It doesn’t matter how good your engineering or UX team is if they are not given the right thing to build."
- Marty Cagan, Silicon Valley Product Group

* Story maps

** Backbone example

Arrive -> Find event -> Chose event -> Enter event -> Buy Merchandise -> Play -> Confirm entry -> Share


** Requirements Hierarchy

- Vision
Start at the top: what’s the Big Picture? (Vision)

- Goal
What goals might you like to achieve & How might goals be met incrementally? (Release Goals)

- Features
What features help achieve those goals? (Features or Epic Stories)

- Ordered Product Backlog
What order are we going to deliver those in? (Product Backlog)

- Stories
Requirements as stories, with acceptance criteria

- Tasks
What tasks are required to implement the stories in an iteration?


* Traditional/Waterfall vs. Agile

- Traditional/Waterfall
The Plan creates the Cost/schedule estimates.

- Agile
Cost and Schedule are constrained, Value drives the estimated feature set.


* Minimum viable product (MVP)


* Other tools for establishing a shared vision

** Teams do best when they have a "clear, elevating goal" and "unified commitment".

** Other tools:
- Elevator statement

- Product data sheeet

- Product vision box

- Magazine review

- Advanced data sheet

- Press release:
Do a press release for the product as to why is it successful.


(*) Audiences/Users/Clients and evidence

Data driven decision making.

(*) Recap

* Clear ownership and vision is key.
* Adopt iterative techniques – build out the most value first.
* Involve audiences at every stage.
* Bring stakeholders with you through the process.

(*) Notes

What is a Product manager's worst nightmare?
A failed product!

- Didn't understand requirements.
- Built it wrong.
- Didn't communicate it well enough to clients.

* Techniques

** Planning (Shape)
- Focus groups
- Polls, surveys
- Search social media
- What do people do at the moment, and how do we change/improve this?
-- Pitfalls
-- Positives
- Use prototypes

** Building (Build)
- Usability testing
- MVPs

** Live (Run)
- A/B testing
- Feedback from users
-- Forums
-- Social media
- User analytics

Instead of having a Product Manager who does strategy and a Product Owner who delivers/implements that strategy it's better to have a Product Manager who does both.

A Product Manager's job is to steer the product, set out the strategy and set out as to where this product is heading and deliver and implement this strategy, where as a Project Manager's job is to manage development, resources and the risks of the product as it progresses through it's life-cycle.

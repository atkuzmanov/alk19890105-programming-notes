Same with word forward, just use F.

Hersâ€™s how to make iTerm2 to support alt-b and alt-f:

Command-; to bring up the Preference menu
Select Keys tab
Click + button on the bottom of the right section (see the red cycle on the screen shot)
Add shortcut key (see the red rectangle on the screen shot) for alt-f and alt-b
Profit
```
